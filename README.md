# Grade Calculator App (COM5003 Assignment 2)
This app helps students calculate their final grade or personally desired final grade by inputing what grade they have achived or desired from each module and calculates final grade  . The app also connects to Firebase to save and fetch student data.

## Github Rep
// final version of AS2

## Features
- you can add your module name with description and grades& credits you have achived or desire
- Calculate final grade average and classification (e.g., First, 2:1,fail)
- What-if mode: test predicted or desired grade by the student so it will guide them to set targets for upcoming assigments
- Save results to Firebase Realtime Database
- Fetch saved data from Firebase and view it

## Technologies Used
- java 
- Firebase Realtime Database 
- ML layout
- feedback on user input
- Custom logic and structure (no frameworks or libraries)
- firebase logcat testing

## Standout features 
- input module, name , level, grade, credits
- calculate grade
- User input feedback 
- Supports UG/PG/FY calssification
- what-if toggle to inpute desired or predicted grade

## Monitisation plan 
- free version simple with side ads using Admob (feature implementasion)
- Premium tier (future) allow in sharing results with mentors also sharing data, notification on submition results and updated tracks saying if you are on target to reach desired grade

## reflection

This project taught me about how to really  what it takes to build a functional app and the amount of consideratin you need to take from every aspect from functionality to user experiance 

## Firebase 
- User authention 
- realtime stored database per user 
- polished and tested via logcat

## Refrences 
useruniprogress is Based on ideas from:
https://github.com/deblinaroy11/CodSoft_Task_2

## How to Run
1. Open the project in any Java IDE (e.g., VS Code or IntelliJ)
2. Run the RsultSim class
3. Input your module data
4. Use the "Calculate" or "What-If" buttons to test your outcome
5. Click "Save Result" to store your data in Firebase

## Firebase Integration
- Uses HTTP POST and GET to communicate with Firebase Realtime Database
- Database URL and secret key are configured in CalcDatabase.java

## Notes
AI STATMENT 
- This project was written by a student following Leeds Trinity University's COM5003 brief
-feedback, suggestions, error detection and planning. I can confirm that it was all my ideas and understanding
- Some required code (e.g., Firebase boilerplate) uses standard structure due to Firebase constraints
- All logic, comments, and structure were personalised to stay within 20% AI assistance
